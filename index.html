        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Landrick. I was born in St. Petersburg, Florida. After graduating from Gibbs High School, I moved to Orlando to attend UCF for a psychology degree that I changed two more times before dropping out in my third year. 
        I played organized football from the time I was 7 through my senior year in high school.</p>
        <p>After leaving UCF, I joined the United States Marine Corps, where I ended up in Afghanistan looking for bombs. After separating honorably, I went back home to Florida and enrolled back in college. After a year in Florida, I moved back to California, where I ended up graduating from California State University, Long Beach, where I also completed half of a master's in Medieval Literature.</p>
